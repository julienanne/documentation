Using Vagrant
=============

You can try Kanboard with Vagrant very easily:

-  Clone the project from the git repository
-  Execute ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`` to install guest additions
-  Execute ``vagrant up``
-  You can access to the application by using the URL
   ``http://localhost:8001/``

The virtual machine is based on Ubuntu 20.04 and PHP 7.4.
